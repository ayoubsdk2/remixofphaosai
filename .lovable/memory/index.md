# Project Memory

## Core
- **White-Labeling**: Fully white-labeled "Phaos AI". Dark theme (#0a0a0a) with Electric Purple (#a855f7) glassmorphism. Never expose 3rd party infra.
- **Domain Focus**: Print & Copier industry. Persona: Phoebe (Sharp MFP technical expert).
- **Voice Infrastructure**: Use `@vapi-ai/web` WebRTC + Cartesia Sonic. `window.speechSynthesis` is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
- **Security**: All API keys managed via Supabase Edge Functions. RLS enforced on database tables.
- **Automation**: Vapi webhooks automatically parse transcripts into `service_tickets` and scored leads via Edge Functions.
